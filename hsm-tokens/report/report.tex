\section{High-level description of our solution }
The goal of his task was to move the sensitive operations from the Go library to a PKCS\#11 token (using SoftHSM). In particular, we were supposed to focus on RSA and ECC: key generation and export, signatures, decryptions and ECDH. We needed to work with SoftHSM, which is written in C, so we found a a PKCS\#11 wrapper for Go: \url{https://github.com/miekg/pkcs11}.

We tried to create a flexible solution that should have an interface compatible with the one used for the corresponding functionalities in Go.
%Bonus: verify and encrypt implemented (to facilitate testing)


\section{An overview of the implemented functionality}
For RSA we've implemented key pair generation, signing and signature verification, encryption and decryption and export of the public key. For ECDSA signing and signature verification and export of the public key We've almost implemented ECDH, but got stuck on how to properly fill the PKCS\#11 \verb+CK_ECDH1_DERIVE_PARAMS+ structure and pass it on the HSM. Apart from that, there are few interesting functions for managing the HSM like \lstinline[columns=fixed]{findSlot()}, that searches the available slots for the appropriate token (based on the token label) and fails in case of either zero or mutliple matches. The second interesting function is \lstinline[columns=fixed]{FindKeyHandle()}, that searches the token for the object handle of the key and performs similar checks.

\section{Comparison with original Go implementation}
We've tried to follow the current Go implementation of RSA and ECDSA as closely as possible. For that we have the same package hierarchy, similar structures for private and public keys and since Go partially uses interfaces (e.g. \lstinline[columns=fixed]|type Signer interface {...}|), we've followed them as well.

\textit{$\bullet$ How to ensure the value of the private key is never exposed on the PC and is only present inside the token?}

The private key is never directly accessible to the developer. Only through\\ \lstinline[columns=fixed]{type PrivateKey struct} he can call set of functions (as from the \lstinline[columns=fixed]{Signer} interface above) like \lstinline[columns=fixed]{Sign}, \lstinline[columns=fixed]{Decrypt}.

\textit{$\bullet$ How to obtain the PIN from the user?}\\
\indent\textit{$\bullet$ How and where to configure the path to the PKCS\#11 dll/so library?}

Handling of both (PIN and path to PKCS\#11 lib) is left for the developer. He can set them as environment variables, get them interactively from the user, etc. An example setup can be seen in \ref{lst:hsmInit}. Since we accept only a pointer to the PIN we leave the burder of safely destroying the PIN to the developer. This is reasonably secure in expected scenarios.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Comparison of the original and HSM implementations, captionpos=b, label={lst:hsmInit}]
    pathToLib := "/usr/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so"
    tokenLabel := "pv204"
    pin := "1234" // pin hardcoded only for the sake of an example!
    hsmInstance := hsm_crypto.New(pathToLib, tokenLabel, &pin)
    err := hsmInstance.Initialize()
    defer hsmInstance.Finalize()
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
\end{lstlisting}

After the setup in \ref{lst:hsmInit} we can use \lstinline[columns=fixed]{hsmInstance} for function that generate RSA/ECDSA keys. To show, that to use the HSM in existing code is not that difficult see the examples \ref{lst:rsaComp}, that generates a RSA key. The function \lstinline[columns=fixed]{getGoRSAKey} is using the original implementation, the second function \lstinline[columns=fixed]{getHSMRSAKey} is using our.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Initialization of the HSM, captionpos=b, label={lst:rsaComp}]
func getGoRSAKey() (key *rsa.PrivateKey, err error) {
    reader := rand.Reader
    bitSize := 2048
    key, err = rsa.GenerateKey(reader, bitSize)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    return key, nil
}

func getHSMRSAKey(hsmInstance *hsm_crypto.Hsm)
(key rsa_hsm.PrivateKey, err error) {
    bitSize := uint(2048)
    key, err = rsa_hsm.GenerateKey(bitSize, hsmInstance)
    if err != nil {
        return key, err
    }
    return key, nil
}
\end{lstlisting}

The notable differences are the need to pass the \lstinline[columns=fixed]{hsmInstance}. Even the package name does not matter much, because \lstinline[columns=fixed]{rsa_hsm} can be imported under different name (e.g. \lstinline[columns=fixed]{rsa}). Later we've discovered, that we are not returning a pointer to the \lstinline[columns=fixed]{PrivateKey} structure as in the original implementation, so this should be fixed, to make it even more consistent.

Other functions do not have much differences either. E.g. \lstinline[columns=fixed]{PrivateKey.Sign} method is not using the rand, that is provided (quite logically, the HSM is expected to have it's own and hopefully stronger source of randomness).

\textit{$\bullet$ How to match and find private key on the token based on the key\_ctx used by library?}

This is done by the \lstinline[columns=fixed]{FindKeyHandle} function, which similarly to \lstinline[columns=fixed]{findSlot} iterates over the objects on the HSM and either returns the handle (based on 64 byte random value saved inside the key structure) or an error in case of zero or multiple matching objects. This function is now a method of the public key, but should be reimplemented to work on any object -- private key, public key, shared secret key, etc.

\section{Troubles, shortcomings and the good and the future}

\subsection{PKCS\#11 headaches}
Working wiht PKCS\#11 was not straightforward in any case. It took some time to provide the correct information for the templates, that are expected by the PKCS\#11 wrapper functions. The documentation helped only somewhat (e.g. this one \url{http://docs.oasis-open.org/pkcs11/pkcs11-base/v2.40/os/pkcs11-base-v2.40-os.html}). For better understanding we've googled for as many examples (even from different languages/bindings) as possible.

\subsection{Too rigid implementation}
At this moment our implementation is still a prototype -- but a working one. It means, that in several functions we have hardcoded mechanisms and parameters. For example in the \lstinline[columns=fixed]{PrivateKey.Sign} we don't use the parameter, which specifies the hash function, that should be used on the data before signing. This is of course unwanted, but is not a major issue, rather next logical step in the implementation.

Similarly, the problems with PKCS\#11 stopped us from finishing the implementation of ECDH shared secret derivation function. We've implemented most of it, but it is not quite there. Of course, we could hack our way around that, by getting the public value (e.g. from the server) and getting the private value from the HSM and manually multiple them, but this would contracted the claim about the safeness of the private key (never leaving the HSM).

\subsection{The restart of a session}
Restarting the session is a logical think, that might happen. However, we did not handle this direclty. That means, that at this moment the developer would have to track the aliveness of the session and in case it dies reinitialize the particular structures and reassign the object handles. We could proceed further and make this easier for the developer, but at this moment we've only discussed, what the possible scenarios could be and decided not to make the library code \textit{too} clever and potentially introduce another flaw (maybe allowing the attacker to plug in their card etc.).

\subsection{Documentation and tests}
At this moment we do not have almost any documentation -- again, the code is a working prototype. Apart from documentation it would be nice to have a proper test suite. But that's hard to do in case of using HSM (testing against SoftHSM does not test the whole Pipeline). But we could have a general test suite, that each user/developer could run against a particular HSM and therefore verify the functionality. We do, however, have basic examples, that provide basic assurance of the funcitonality.

\subsection{Looking into the future}
Making upstream changes seems quite a challenge. But the basic building blocks are there. There are few question though -- our code uses 3rd party PKCS\#11 binding, that would also need to be included in the source code (depends, how big of a problem that might be). Our code also does not implement all the functionality of the Go's crypto package. But overall we feel like our contribution might be of an interest to the original maintainers and therefore we are strongly considering at least putting the most interesting findings and references to the HSM implementation into an email and contacting the maintainers of Go.
